# sbrbench

1. We improve the label correctness of five publicly available SBR (Security bug report) prediction datasets: Ambari, Camel, Derby, Wicket, and Chromium. We manually analyze each bug report, and recall 749 SBRs, which are originally mislabeled as Non-SBRs (NSBRs).

2. We evaluate the impact of data label correctness on SBR prediction models.
